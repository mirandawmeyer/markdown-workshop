# Description
This course will examine the development of criminal law and the social construction of criminality as a reflection of Latin American society from colonial times through today. The objective is to understand Law, Justice and Citizenship in a historical perspective, and as categories that have changed through Latin American History, and were intrinsically related to the social structures and the projects of colonization and nation building. Also, it seeks to see them as part of complex and contradictory social practices that were influenced but not determined by legal codes and constitutions.

I am available to meet with students by appointment; please contact me by email to set up a mutually convenient time.

The readings for this class will be posted on blackboard/Cuny-First. For those who wish to complement the readings of the course, the recommended books for the basic outline of the history of law and crime in Latin America are listed below. Both are on reserve on the John Jay library.

1. Salvatore, Aguirre, Joseph, eds., *Crime and Punishment in Latin America: Law and Society 
Since Late Colonial Times* (Duke UP, 2001)
2. Aguirre and Buffington, *Reconstructing criminality in Latin America* (Scholarly Resources, 2000). 


# Requirements
The following are requirements for this course.

1. Presentation: oral presentation + written take on the readings. Beginning on the second week of the semester, each student will take a turn at making a brief presentation (of ten minutes, maximum) that will serve to introduce the class discussion. Your presentation should focus on the readings for that week, and it should pose questions to the class that will spark discussion and, ideally, debate. These presentations are designed to allow you to focus carefully on the week's theme and to bring up the issues you believe are important, and for you to hear each other’s insights on the texts that we will be reading and their importance in history. Also, on the week you are presenting, you will have to e-mail me in advance (the deadline is 48 hours before the class you are going to present) a small-paper (1 page is fine; 2 pages maximum) with the bulk of your presentation, and the list of questions you will pose during your oral presentation. During the first week, I will circulate a sign-up sheet, and students will be asked to sign themselves up for whichever week they would prefer to present.

2. Quizzes. Over the course of the semester, you will have to take short (10-15 minute) quizzes. I will give these quizzes weekly. The quiz question(s) will concern the readings assigned for that week’s classes. The only way to prepare for these quizzes is to do your reading every single week. That means that all of the readings of the week should be done by Monday. It is very important to note that these quizzes will be given at the very beginning of class. Students who arrive late may not make up the quiz. Therefore, if you arrive late to class, not only will you disrupt the class but you will also risk missing a quiz. In some weeks I might substitute the quizzes for a different activity, but I will let you know beforehand. The quizzes are not going to be graded, they will be either considered acceptable or not-acceptable. By the end of the semester, 10 acceptable quizzes will account for maximum grade in this section. That means that you can miss or fail 3 quizzes and still get the full grade.

3. Final Paper: You will have one major writing assignment to complete outside of class: a final paper (1000 – 1500 words). Further instructions and information will be provided later.

3. Readings: Unless otherwise indicated, all readings assigned are required.  It is critical that you come to class having completed the readings indicated for that day and having given careful thought to what you’ve read.

4. Attendance/ late policy.  Please note that class participation accounts for 10% of your grade, and only if you attend class can you participate in it. If you need to miss class for a religious holiday or an emergent personal matter, please make every effort to come talk to me beforehand. Furthermore, please do not forget that learning is a collaborative effort; your attendance in class includes not simply showing up but also participating actively in the group learning endeavor.  
Please observe the due dates listed on this syllabus carefully, as late work will be marked down at the rate of one grade per day.

5. academic honesty. I expect you to adhere rigorously to a high standard of academic honesty.  Plagiarism will result in a grade of F for the assignment in question.

6. Policy concerning handheld/ portable electronic devices.  Please be sure to power down your cell phones and put them completely away during class. Laptop computers are permitted in this class only for taking notes or for work directly related to the class. Surfing the internet, looking at social media, or checking email are strictly prohibited.
